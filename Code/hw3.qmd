## Set up

```{r}
#| message: false

#Loading Packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(gt)
library(flextable)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(ggtext)
library(ggimage)

#Read in data 
data <- read_csv(here("data","my_data.csv"))

```

## Problem 1

a.  I could calculate the mean focus duration to compare how long I stayed focused between different background noise levels (e.g., quiet, semi-loud, loud), because I suspect that noise distractions in the library or living room affect my ability to concentrate. This comparison would help me understand whether quieter environments are actually leading to longer periods of focus.

b.  Visualization

```{r}
# clean and organize dataset (just in case)
clean_data <- data |>
  clean_names() |> 
   mutate(
    background_noise = str_trim(background_noise),  #removing whitespace from background noise column
    background_noise = factor(background_noise, levels = c("quite", "semi-loud", "loud"))
  )  # treating background noise as factor with specific order 

# plotting focus duration by background noise 
ggplot(data, aes(x = background_noise, y = focus_duration_hrs,fill = background_noise)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, color = "black", size = 2, alpha = 0.7) + # adding individual data points with jitter and customizing size, color, and spread
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "bar", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.6, color = "black") + # adding mean bars of focus duration for each background noise level and customizing color, size. 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("quite" = "#1f78b4", "semi-loud" = "#33a02c", "loud" = "#e31a1c")) + # manually coloring each bar for background noise level 
  labs(
    title = "Average Focus Duration by Background Noise", # tittle label 
    x = "Background Noise Level", # x-axis label 
    y = "Focus Duration (hours)", # y-axis label 
    fill = "Noise Level"    # legend title
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) #minimalist theme with large base font size

```

c.  Caption

This figure shows the relationship between background noise level and focus duration (in hours). Individual observations are jittered, while bars represent the average focus time for each noise category. The data suggest that quieter environments may support longer periods of focused work.

d.  Table Representation

```{r}
# creating summary table object
summary_table <- clean_data |> 
  group_by(background_noise) |> # grouping by background noise 
  summarise(mean_focus = round(mean(focus_duration_hrs),1)) |>  #calculating mean focus duration and round to 1 decimal
  gt() |>   #converting summary table data into gt table 
  tab_header(
    title = "Mean Focus Duration by Background Noise Level" # adding table header 
  ) |>
  cols_label(        # labeling columns 
    background_noise = "Background Noise Level", 
    mean_focus = "Mean Focus Duration (hrs)"
  )

# display table
summary_table 
```


## Problem 2 

a. Effective visualization 

An affective visualization of my data could explore how my focus duration changes on days I attended work versus days I didn’t. I might use tall, structured rectangles to represent “work days,” with muted or darker colors to reflect the mental effort and rigidity of scheduled responsibilities. In contrast, “non-work days” could be shown with lighter, softer-colored flowing shapes or curves, representing a more relaxed, open-ended focus. The height or area of each shape would reflect my recorded focus duration, allowing viewers to feel the contrast between how structured time versus free time affects my ability to concentrate. This visualization would highlight the emotional difference between obligation-driven and self-directed focus in my daily life.

b. Create a sketch

c. Make a draft

d. Artist statement 

My piece shows how focus time varies with background noise, using a tree with three branches — one for each noise level — where branch height reflects average focus time and birds represent individual data points.

I was inspired by affective data visualizations and nature-themed aesthetics that combine emotion with information which fitted well into my data type. 

This is a hand-drawn piece created with just pencil on paper. 

I analyzed my data to group focus time by noise level, then translated that into a symbolic tree where height and bird count visually represent the data.

## Problem 3 

a. The authors are addressing whether wetland restoration effectively enhances ecosystem services and biodiversity. They used paired t-test to compare native plant species richness between restored and unrestored wetlands and linear mixed-effects models for soil variables, Olsen P, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), incorporating fixed effects like restoration status and distance from water’s edge, and random effects such as site identity and plot nested within site.

b. Visual clarity 

I believe the authors clearly represented their statistics in the figure, the x- and y-axes are logically positioned and labeled, and the bar graphs show means with standard error bars. They include summary statistics for each variable (Soil Organic Carbon, Olsen P, Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity, and Native Plant Species Richness), along with significance indicators from models shown by asterisks that are defined in figure description. 

c. Aesthetic clarity

The authors handled visual clutter well by using a clean and simple bar graph layout with minimal text and clearly labeled axes. The data:ink ratio is high, most of the visual elements directly represent data (bars and error bars, asterisks), with very little extraneous decoration or unnecessary labeling. This makes the figure easy to interpret and visually efficient.

d. Recommendations 

My recommendations for this figure is to add individual data points to add transparency to the figure. Both bars are gray, I believe color contrast would add more clarity to the figure and in understanding data. Another thing that can improve the clarity when comparing the significance on each site is adding the is placing the asterisks directly into each bar instead of having it at the top with text (e.g Restoration**)
